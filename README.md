# Retail Store Checkout
## General
This program simulates different variables that affect a retail store's checkout receipt, such as sales tax for different states, holiday greeting headers and mail-in rebate offers that belong on the bottom.
### Design Patterns
This program was meant to showcase severy Object Oriented design patterns, with the program making use of the Decorator and Factory methods.
### Operation
The program has a built-in menu that allows a user to view items in the store, add items to the cart, and enter in personal information like his/her address. Afterwards, the program calculates:
  -State Sales Tax
  -Sales Tax Free Weekends (for back to school)
  -Seasonal Headers to add on top of Receipt
  -Whether certain items qualify for a mail-in rebate
It then prints all applicable categories to the receipt in the correct order.
